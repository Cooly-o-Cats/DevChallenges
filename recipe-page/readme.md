## Overview

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- I can see a recipe with ingredients and instructions
- I can select a checkbox if I have the ingredients
- I can see the number of servings, baking times

## My process

### Built with

-  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Iconscout React Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) - React Icons
- [A JSON File](https://www.jsonkeeper.com/b/U56A/)

### What I learned
I decided to use a JSON File for the project so that you could reuse this page and just change the file's contents.

One thing I learned was how to use CSS modules in NextJS. This allowed for cleaner code organization. And makes it very easy to tell which CSS Files are affecting which components.

Creating the Checkboxes for each ingredient proved to be hard. I combined a bunch of ideas from various Codepen's and such to create the ingredient component that I used; I'm very happy with it.

### Continued development

I enjoyed working with NextJS, and I hope to use it to create more projects in the future as well as try out new frameworks.

### Useful resources

  

-  [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) - Codepen can be used to find little snippets of code that may help you in projects.
