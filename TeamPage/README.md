## Overview

![Alt Text](https://i.ibb.co/Qd9tFh3/cooly-o-cats-github-io-Dev-Challenges-Team-Page.png)

This was my second challenge on **devchallenges.io**, Overall this challenge was simple and easy to complete. However, I used a few unfamiliar CSS Selectors and Properties to complete the challenge.

- First I used **CSS Grid** to position the cards in a grid pattern of 2 x 3 and 3 x 2. CSS Grid is pretty new to me and I'd like to know and use it more.

- Second I used the **writing-mode** CSS property to change the job title text to be written vertically. This was a new property to me, that I had to research. I can use this in the future of my work.

- I also used **:nth-child()** CSS selectors to be able to select different cards. This allowed me to change the margin of them, to give the staggered effect. This is handy to know and is very versatile.
